  ![license](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=license&message=CDDL&color=brightgreen)
  ## Description
  This is an app that creates a quality README with information about the app your creating/working on. Through the terminal you are able to quickly generate a README with a title, table of contents with a description (like here!), installation, usage, contribution, tests, multiple licenses, questions, and contacts that link to your Github profile, and email! This is all in service of making a quick, and easy to create README for ease of use!
  ## Table of Contents
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Contribution](#contribution)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Questions](#questions)
  * [Contacts](#contacts)
  
  ## Installation
  Make sure VS code, GitBash and Node.js are installed on your computer. Copy the link within this github repo, and clone it into your folder. Open your VS code terminal within that folder, and type in "npm inti -y" to install the node package manager. Then "npm install inquirer".
  ## Usage
  After everything is downloaded type into the terminal "node index.js" and begin to fill out the README generator questions. This is what I'm doing right now!!!
